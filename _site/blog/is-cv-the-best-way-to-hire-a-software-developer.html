<p>I really hate doing things I know are borderline bullshit just because they are conventional wisdom. CVs are definitely one of them. First of all, biases always find their way around a CV. Age, sex and name are just some of the information that we now reduct or obfuscate in order to remove certain biases. I would argue we need to deduct the whole CV in order to be somewhat impartial and effective. But then, you might ask, how do we vet people if not through a CV? How would you know about their background, skills and experience if you don’t read their CV?</p>

<p>Let me save you some time. People exaggerate so what you see on a CV is a stretch of their actual experience. The sad thing is everyone knows this. But I’d like to examine a couple of <em>sections</em> on the CV bit closer that reflect my own biases when I’m reading somone’s CV.</p>

<h3 id="education">Education</h3>
<p>Cambridge University. I can hear myself thinking, “Cool this is a smart person”.</p>

<p>University of x. “Meh, I’m not sure about this university. I have heard it before; maybe it’s good, maybe it’s not”.</p>

<p>“Politecnico di Milano”, I can hear my brain shouting “This is not even English! I will not bother checking it out”.</p>

<p>Bootcamp. Well for sure they are not experienced enough. How could they possible know about garbage collection cycles”. For the record, I have no idea about garbage collection cycles apart from that blog post I read 2 years ago on Hacker News. So, you can call me an expert.</p>

<p>So, 4 humans but only 1 seems to be getting a 🥇. Why is that? People often think that discounting university degrees is an attack on formal education. That’s not the case. Maybe it’s an attack on elitism actually. It’s not about making candidate number 1 more but rather why are the other 3 candidates less?</p>

<p>In our great and diverse industry, there are plently of developers that didn’t even study Computer Science. Some of them are the best I know. An example is my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/txustice">Txus</a>.</p>

<p>So how about we drop that section completely? It takes a bit of a real estate on paper as well.</p>

<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>
<p>Fasten your seat belts for this section. Mind the gap as you enter the platform.</p>

<p>When I was at Deliveroo, my CV will probably say, I worked on Kafka to decouple a monolith into microservices with a throughput of 1 billion messages a nanosecond. True story. Actually, partially true. I did work at Deliveroo. And I have used a thing called Kafka. It was provided as a library of course so I was able to call <code class="highlighter-rouge">Kafka.please_publish</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Kafka.please_consume_without_dying_because_i_have_no_idea_what_i_am_doing</code>. I have no idea about the internals of Kafka, what partitions are, how to achieve ordering or how to replay events. Even this is not necessarily true because I was involved with Kafka at carwow and my experience comes from there 😅.</p>

<p>Just because someone worked at a very well known company, doesn’t make them experts in the technology they are claiming they know. Software is about abstractions. Sometimes we don’t see the internals of the technologies we work on. That’s even more true for bigger companies as dedicated teams take care of those pieces. In the case of Deliveroo and Kafka, the Data Engineering team had complete control of it.</p>

<p>The <strong>Experience</strong> section has also another problematic side to it. It’s more or less the same as the education. I guarantee you stop skimming a CV when you come across Twitter, Facebook, Google and Amazon. But not when the name of the company does not ring a bell. There are a plethora of business that are doing excellent work, it’s just not that fancy for Techcrunch. Even consultancies: everyone knows ThoughtWorks (for good reason) but what about a non-known consultancy? Does that mean the developer hasn’t produced quality work? Again, is not about being an engineer at Twitter is less but why being an engineer at x is not more?</p>

<h3 id="buzzwords">Buzzwords</h3>
<p>This is a simple one. As applicants, we are trying to fill CV with the latest cool technologies and words that will make the recruiter look at the CV. No, I hadn’t had the chance to work with Go prior to joining Deliveroo. How long do you think it took me to contribute production code? With the right support system (thanks Antonio et al) I was productive in Go from day 1.</p>

<h3 id="so-whats-the-answer-you-might-ask">So what’s the answer you might ask?</h3>
<p>To be honest, I’m not 100% sure but I tend to find more value in conversational CVs or cover letters as they are called I suppose. There are a lot of benefits, I believe, in a story as opposed to a list of items.</p>

<h4 id="value-in-technical-writing">Value in technical writing</h4>
<p>Often people say, programmers read more code than they write. This is absolutely a true statement. The way in which one writes an email, a technical spec or documentation is often mirrored in their normal writing. A cover letter can highlight the technical writing skills of somone, how they lay out their thoughts. I find that to be an important attribute of any developer I enjoy working with.</p>

<p>There you go, that’s your first gate keeper. If someone puts effort and though in a well written cover letter, it is likely they do the same for their code. A CV is just a incoherent bullet point list of things with no expressional value.</p>

<h4 id="lack-of-personal-identity">Lack of personal identity</h4>
<p>There is nothing more boring than trying to think bullet points for each company so you can showcase you’ve done something. It’s just a cold and impersonal way of trying to highlight your experience. Instead, ask the candidate to answer a few questions?</p>

<p>What have you worked on that you were the most proud of? Which aspect of a technology / business have you personally took ownership for and why? What do you enjoy working on the most? What would you like to work on here?</p>

<p>Just a few simple questions to get the creative juices flowing. People will come up with their own, unique way of expressing themselves.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Even though I truly believe this is a better way to hire both the the company and the candidate, I don’t see changing it in the near future. I will probably run the above as an experiment at <a href="https://www.creditdigital.co.uk">CreditDigital</a> and see the results.</p>
