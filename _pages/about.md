I've been fortunate enough to have lived in New York, Berlin &amp; London, and worked for some of the best companies such as <a href="https://deliveroo.co.uk">Deliveroo</a> and <a href="https://carwow.co.uk">carwow</a>. At heart, I'm a Ruby developer with ❤ for Go, Elm and Elixir.

I'm fascinated by the interactions, processeses and building blocks that constitute a valuable product. As such, startups have been an invaluable learning experience that have helped shape my thinking around people, products and business. I hope I can share some of that in this blog. Without a doubt my main influence has been Basecamp. <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com">Singal v. Noise</a> along with their <a href="https://basecamp.com/books">published books</a> are a great source of learning and inspiration to me.

If you don't find me coding, I'm probably reading, travelling, snorkeling or snowboarding.

I owe a great deal of gratitude to a number of people that helped me jump start my career. Just some of these people are <a href="https://twitter.com/superdealloc">Andre</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mnemonikk">Anselm</a>. Technically not a single person but the Ruby community is without a doubt the most welcoming and open community of people I've had the pleasure of interacting with.

People I'd love to meet: <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">DHH</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Oprah">Oprah</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenfry">Stephen Fry</a>.

People you should definitely follow on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/sehurlburt">Stephanie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11">Patrick</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jessfraz">Jessie</a> and of course <a href="https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield">Chris</a>.
